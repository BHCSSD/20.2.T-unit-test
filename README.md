# Coding Test

Please complete the following coding tasks. You must make sure to clearly label where each question is in your code with: `// Question 1` `//Questions 2`

1. **Creating the Structure** display your output into quadrant 1
   
   - Write the code to declare and initialize an empty array called `myArray`.
   - add 11 numbers to your array (do not use the numbers 42 or 17) using **index numbers**
   - Insert the value `42` at the end of the array.
   - Delete the element at index `2`.
   - Replace the value at index `1` with `17`.



2. **Searching, Finding, and Retrieving Data** Display your output in quadrant 2

   - You are given an array called `data` with the elements `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50,60,70,80,90,100]`
   - Write code to check if the value `30` is present in the array, and display the result clearly
   - Find the index of `40` in the array, display it on the screen




3. **Function sum and average** display your output into quadrant 3

   - Write a function that takes in an array and displays both the sum and average.
   - Use `data2` to test your function 


4. **If time, draw a something** display in quadrant 4.
    - not for marks

```
// data =[10, 20, 30, 40, 50,60,70,80,90,100]
// data2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]

function setup() {
  createCanvas(800, 800); 
}

function draw() {
  background(255);
  text("Quad 1", 10,10)// dont touch these please
  text("Quad 2", 210,10)// dont touch these please
  text("Quad 3", 10,210)// dont touch these please
  text("Quad 4", 210,210)// dont touch these please
  line(200,0,200,400);// dont touch these please
  line(0,200,400,200);//// dont touch these please
}
```
